# What is Hyprpaper?
It's responsible for setting and controlling wallpapers in Hyprland.

(It's not activated by default; you have to install and configure it separately.)

It's a **wallpaper daemon** (a background wallpaper program that can: Support **multiple monitors**, Use very little resources, and integrate seamlessly with Hyprland (made by the same developers).

# 1. Install

```bash
sudo pacman -S hyprpaper
```

---

# 2. Create configuration

File in:

```
~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf
```
If it's not there and you already have hyprpaper installed, you can create the corresponding directory and file.

Example file text:

```ini
# Monitors and backgrounds
preload = ~/Images/background1.jpg
preload = ~/Images/background2.png

wallpaper = eDP-1, ~/Images/background1.jpg
wallpaper = HDMI-A-1, ~/Images/background2.png

# Scale the image
splash = false
```

Replace `eDP-1` and `HDMI-A-1` with the actual names of your monitors (`hyprctl monitors` displays them).

The syntax is very similar to hyprland, with a few changes.

# 3. Start it automatically with Hyprland

In your `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`, add:

```ini
exec-once = hyprpaper
```

This means that every time you log into your PC with hyprland, the hyprpaper program will run, meaning the wallpaper will be set when you start your PC.
