# What is Hyprland

It's a dynamic tiling Wayland window manager and compositor, known for its fluid animations, extreme customization, and aesthetic appeal (it's not for beginners and requires Linux knowledge to configure).

# Requirements

* Have Arch Linux.
* Use Hyprland as your primary display manager (i.e., have Hyprland enabled).

# Guide

When you have Hyprland installed, you should have a default file at this location. If you don't have it and Hyprland is installed, you can create it yourself, but you'll need to confirm that you have it installed first.

```
~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
```

In this file, you can define keyboard shortcuts, themes, toolbars, background, window animations, etc.

You can split the configuration into several files, for example:

``` py
~/.config/hypr/
├─ hyprland.conf   # main file
├─ keybinds.conf   # keyboard shortcuts
├─ appearance.conf # borders, gaps, animations
└─ autostart.conf  # programs that start upon login
```

And include them like this in **hyprland**:

``` ini
source = keybinds.conf
source = appearance.conf
source = autostart.conf
```

## hyprland syntax
It's not a programming language, and its syntax is similar to an .ini file; it's the hyprland configuration syntax.

Each line is a directive in the form of:

``` ini
key = value
```

Basic syntax:

``` ini
# This is a comment
key = value                 # simple assignment
$mainMood = SUPER           # variables
general { ... }             # blocks
bind = key, action, command # Arguments in a directive
```
