# Welcome

In this repository you will find:
1. Arch Linux installation (install.md file).
2. Concepts for configuring the operating system.

> Note: To replicate my operating system configuration, I will have a repository called config-ArchLinux where all my configurations for the operating system I use (Arch Linux) will be stored.

This will be a guide on how to fully customize your operating system. It will primarily cover topics such as configuration files for each case, from configuring the terminal, windows, etc., to configuring the startup and shutdown of the operating system.

# Important Note

It is important to know that this repository is not intended to be a step-by-step guide to configuring Arch Linux, but rather to guide new users. It is important to research how things work separately, and the different topics in this guide. You will need to research the specific operation of anything or the specific customization syntax for something on your own.

This guide is intended as a guide, not a course.
You'll have to research the necessary command syntax on your own, although with AI these days, it's not necessary to spend hours researching, and this guide will be very useful with AI's help.

# Syllabus

1. Installation (install.md file).

2. Hyprland Window Manager (folder).
